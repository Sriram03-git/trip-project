**Collaborative Expense Splitter & Settlement App (Java/Spring Boot, JPA, JavaScript/Chart.js)**

A full-stack application for group financial management. Implemented a robust debt simplification algorithm (Minimizing transactions using Priority Queues) to calculate optimal settlements among users. Features include user/expense CRUD operations, persistence via Spring Data JPA, and API logic to distinguish between Group (splittable) and Personal (non-splittable) expenses. Includes a dynamic frontend dashboard using Chart.js for net balance visualization and category-wise spending breakdown.
